<h1 id="answer">Answer</h1>
<h3 id="main-question-what-is-federated-learning-in-the-context-of-machine-learning">Main Question: What is Federated Learning in the context of machine learning?</h3>
<p>Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training to occur on local devices holding data, without the need to centralize the data. The main idea behind Federated Learning is to leverage data from multiple devices or edge systems while keeping the data locally stored and not sharing it with a central server. This approach helps preserve user privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the objective of Federated Learning can be formulated as follows. Given <span class="arithmatex"><span class="MathJax_Preview">K</span><script type="math/tex">K</script></span> participating devices indexed by <span class="arithmatex"><span class="MathJax_Preview">k \in \{1, 2, ..., K\}</span><script type="math/tex">k \in \{1, 2, ..., K\}</script></span>, and a global model parameterized by <span class="arithmatex"><span class="MathJax_Preview">\theta</span><script type="math/tex">\theta</script></span>, the goal is to minimize the global loss function across all devices, where each local loss function is defined as <span class="arithmatex"><span class="MathJax_Preview">L_k(\theta)</span><script type="math/tex">L_k(\theta)</script></span>:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">
<div class="MathJax_Preview">\text{minimize } J(\theta) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{n_k}{n} L_k(\theta)</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{minimize } J(\theta) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{n_k}{n} L_k(\theta)</script>

<h3 id="role-of-local-updates-in-federated-learning"><strong>Role of Local Updates in Federated Learning</strong></h3>
<p>Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that allows for model training without centralizing data. Local updates play a crucial role in the Federated Learning framework by enabling devices to train models locally on their own data without sharing sensitive information with a central server. These local updates help in preserving privacy while aggregating knowledge from multiple devices to improve the global model.</p>
<p>In Federated Learning, the training process involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialization</strong>: The global model is initialized, typically at a central server or in the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribution of Model</strong>: The global model is distributed to the local devices, such as smartphones or IoT devices, for training on their respective datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local Model Training</strong>: Each client device trains the model locally on its data using techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or federated averaging. The local updates involve computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aggregation</strong>: The updated model parameters from the client devices are aggregated at the central server using techniques like federated averaging or weighted averaging to obtain an improved global model that reflects the knowledge learned from all clients.</p>
</li>
</ol>
